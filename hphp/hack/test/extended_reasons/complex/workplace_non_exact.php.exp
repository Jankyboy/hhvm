Expected <expr#3> as C1

  where <expr#3> is a reference to this expression

File workplace_non_exact.php, line 12, character 5 - line 12, character 13:

But got C1

File workplace_non_exact.php, line 9, character 11 - line 9, character 12:

 9 |   private »C1« $c1;
10 | 
11 |   public function fInstance(): void {
12 |     $this->c1->f($this->c1);
13 |     $c1 = $this->c1;
14 |     $c1->f($c1);
15 |   }

Since C1 is not final

File workplace_non_exact.php, line 9, character 11 - line 9, character 12:

 8 | abstract class Test {
 9 |   private »C1« $c1;
10 | 
11 |   public function fInstance(): void {
12 |     $this->c1->f($this->c1);
13 |     $c1 = $this->c1;
14 |     $c1->f($c1);
15 |   }

this might not be a C1

File workplace_non_exact.php, line 9, character 11 - line 9, character 12:

 8 | abstract class Test {
 9 |   private »C1« $c1;
10 | 
11 |   public function fInstance(): void {
12 |     $this->c1->f($this->c1);
13 |     $c1 = $this->c1;
14 |     $c1->f($c1);
15 |   }

Here's why:

I checked the subtype constraint in [Main] because it was implied by transitivity.

  [Main] Step 1 of 1                          (here is where the error occurred) 

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint

File workplace_non_exact.php, line 9, character 11 - line 9, character 12:

 8 | abstract class Test {
 9 |   private »C1« $c1;
10 | 
11 |   public function fInstance(): void {
12 |     $this->c1->f($this->c1);
13 |     $c1 = $this->c1;
14 |     $c1->f($c1);
15 |   }

which is defined here

File workplace_non_exact.php, line 3, character 16 - line 3, character 17:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | abstract class »C1« {
 4 |   public function f(this $_): void {
 5 |   }
 6 | }

The supertype comes from this hint

File workplace_non_exact.php, line 4, character 21 - line 4, character 24:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | abstract class C1 {
 4 |   public function f(»this« $_): void {
 5 |   }
 6 | }

I found the subtype for [Main] is when I checked the subtype constraint in [Lower].

  [Lower] Step 1 of 1

13 |     $c1 = $this->c1;
14 |     $c1->f($c1);
15 |   }

(its definition was given in [Main / Step 1])

The supertype comes from this type variable
