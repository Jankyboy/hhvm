error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

File instance_prop.php, line 9, character 10 - line 9, character 11:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): int {
 8 |   $x = $c->foo;
 9 |   return »$x«;
10 | }

Expected int

File instance_prop.php, line 7, character 21 - line 7, character 23:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): »int« {
 8 |   $x = $c->foo;
 9 |   return $x;
10 | }

But got bool

File instance_prop.php, line 4, character 10 - line 4, character 13:

 3 | class C {
 4 |   public »bool« $foo = true;
 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): int {

Here's why:

I checked the subtype constraint in [Main] because it was implied by transitivity.

  [Main] Step 1 of 1                          (here is where the error occurred) 

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint

File instance_prop.php, line 4, character 10 - line 4, character 13:

 3 | class C {
 4 |   public »bool« $foo = true;
 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): int {

The supertype comes from this hint

File instance_prop.php, line 7, character 21 - line 7, character 23:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(C $c): »int« {
 8 |   $x = $c->foo;
 9 |   return $x;
10 | }

I found the subtype for [Main] is when I checked the subtype constraint in [Lower].

  [Lower] Step 1 of 1
