Create edits for the changes you wish to make in order to fix the problem and explain your reasoning; these changes may be in any file mentioned in the diagnostic;\n\n5. Ensure the proposed solution is syntactically correct and does not introduce new errors or warnings;\n\n6. Evaluate the proposed solution and explain why it is the best solution to the problem. Whilst evaluating, please consider the following:\n- Does the solution introduce type errors (BAD)\n- Does the solution reduce code quality by circumventing the typechecker (e.g. using `as` instead of `is`, using `UNSAFE_CAST` etc) (BAD)\n- Does the solution change the behavior of the program (BAD)\n\n7. If your proposed solution is good, generate an edit that will fix the problem and return it in the code section of the response. If your proposed solution is not good, go back to step 1 and try again.\n",
