WARN: File "like_union2.bad.php", line 15, characters 3-28:
This call has a type argument that is inferred to be a union of disjoint types, but the API is marked to indicate that this is an error. This is typically the case because two entities that are not related to each other are compared to each other. For example, comparing a value of `int` type to a value of `string` type will always result in `false` and is likely a coding mistake. The inferred type in this case is: (int | string) (Warn[12017])
